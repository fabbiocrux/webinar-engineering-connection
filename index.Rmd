Good afternoon everybody
- Thank you for being connected 
- and thank you for invitating me in these enginnering conection organized by the University.

- My name is Fabio Cruz. I’m researcher at the University of Lorraine. 
- In these fifteen minutes, my main point is to present some our our perspective of distributed recycling approach framed in the  the climate change issues

# How Innovation Labs could help to mitigate .brand-red[climate change]: academy-industry partnerships for success?

???

- The global question the presentation is how innovation labs could help to mitigate climate change. 
- from a perspective of academy-industry partnetships experiences

- So let me begin very quickly to this climate change umbrella problem.

# Societal Challegue <br>  Climate change 

.footnote[Source: Intergovermental pannel on Climate change https://www.ipcc.ch/ ]

???

-  According to the Intergovermental pannel from 2018,  We know that climate change, and precisely, the effort to limite the temperature 1.5 degress is the main challengue.

# Climate change

- Global warming estimations
- 6000 scientific references
- Awareness of the impact of human activity
- With 2°C, many ecosystems (corals) will disappear

???

- an increase of the temperature beyond this value, could implicate tipping points for ecosystem, 
- and these tipping points we don't know the impact in the global equilimbium between ecological systems and human systems. 

- Two conclusion from these
 - We need to find ways for meeting  the needs of all people within the means of the living planet.

So the question is Can we continue in the same mental (economic) model ?

## The problem: Plastic waste

.pull-left[ 
- US recycled less than 9% of its plastic waste.
- EU, recycled about 30%. However, this number is what is collected, not from what is in circulation*. 
- China’s ban on plastic trash
- Plastic trash could top 13 billion tons by 2050
- Economics of plastic recycling historically have been challenging
- Little financial incentive to encourage consumers to recycle their own plastic waste

## We barely recycle plastic!!..

# To conclude

- An imperative to act now for the planet
- Assuming our role from the university 
- A holistic, systemic and interdisciplinary vision <br/> is necessary 
- Technology must be considered in <br/> its socio-technical context
- True interdisciplinarity is fundamental <br/>*(let's take the risk)*
- Community integration is indispensable, <br/>it's about **co-building solutions**.
