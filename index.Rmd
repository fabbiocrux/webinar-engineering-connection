# How Innovation Labs could help to mitigate .brand-red[climate change]: academy-industry partnerships for success?

???
??? 


- Thank you for being connected and thank you for invitating me in these enginnering conection organized by the University.
- My name is Fabio Cruz. I’m researcher at the University of Lorraine. 
- In these fifteen minutes, my main point is to present some our our perspective of distributed recycling approach framed in the  the climate change issues


- The global question the presentation is how innovation labs could help to mitigate climate change. 
- from a perspective of academy-industry partnetships experiences

- So let me begin very quickly to this climate change umbrella problem.

# Societal Challegue <br>  Climate change

???

-  According to the Intergovermental pannel from 2018,  We know that climate change, and precisely, the effort to limite the temperature 1.5 degress is the main challengue.

# Climate change 

.left-column[.footnotesize[

- Global warming estimations
- 6000 scientific references
- Awareness of the impact of human activity
- With 2°C, many ecosystems (corals) will disappear

???

- an increase of the temperature beyond this value, could implicate tipping points for ecosystem, 
- and these tipping points we don't know the impact in the global equilimbium between ecological systems and human systems. 

- Two conclusion from these
 - We need to find ways for meeting  the needs of all people within the means of the living planet.

- There have been enourmes research on discourse of a circular econmy. 
- Which it would take many day to get in detail.

- What I want to focus is one approach that we found very holistic and systemics

- Going back to our initial question, I would like to frame your attention in this notion of

- We know from the literature, we have globally thre modes of production and transfer knowledge. 
- Mode 1
- Mode 2
- What we neet for wicked and systematic problems, is mode 3
  - Knowlede innovation mode (open innovation, and co-creation)
  - To integrate the community
  - We create together with users, the knowledge

## The problem: Plastic waste

.pull-left[ 
- US recycled less than 9% of its plastic waste.
- EU, recycled about 30%. However, this number is what is collected, not from what is in circulation*. 
- China’s ban on plastic trash
- Plastic trash could top 13 billion tons by 2050
- Economics of plastic recycling historically have been challenging
- Little financial incentive to encourage consumers to recycle their own plastic waste

## We barely recycle plastic!!..

# To conclude

- An imperative to act now for the planet
- Assuming our role from the university 
- A holistic, systemic and interdisciplinary vision <br/> is necessary 
- Technology must be considered in <br/> its socio-technical context
- True interdisciplinarity is fundamental <br/>*(let's take the risk)*
- Community integration is indispensable, <br/>it's about **co-building solutions**.
